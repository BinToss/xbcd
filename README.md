# BinToss' Archive of Redcl0ud's Projects (and related software)

Until someone has time to decompile or disassembly the binaries in this commit's related GitHub release, this branch will remain relatively devoid of files.

Perhaps, when this branch's related data is separated into driver/software source code and website source code, it can be elevated to a monorepo with git submodules to each project's own repository.

Say, BinToss/Redcl0ud and BinToss/Redcl0ud-XBCD? Or perhaps a GitHub organization with a name that signifies the its purpose e.g. github/redcl0ud-revival/ or something.
