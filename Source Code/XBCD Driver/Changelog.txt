Version 1.2.0
 - Moved driver version and date above the original "1.1.0" to deal with Windows and other apps, (e.g. DriverClean) thinking "0.2.7" precedes the original driver version.
 - Minor tidy up
 - Added some new controller IDs
 - removed references to x360ce (use standalone x360ce instead) 

 Version 0.2.6
 - Fixed 360 LEDs not restoring out of standby.

Version 0.2.5
 - Fixed a serious memory error that makes games display graphic errors and crash.

Version 0.2.4
 - Deadzone is back to it's former self just like it used to be.
 - Deadzone can now be turned off by setting it to 0 _and_ turning Full scale axis off.
 - Added a routine to crop wacky analog stick values so you can have a perfect circle.
 - Changed the format of a _bunch_ of comments, kinda pointless but it trimmed the source by 2 Kb ^_^

Version 0.2.3
 - Deadzone is back this time using the drop-out method: everything inside the deadzone is discarted,
everyting outside is usead as is.
 - Full scale axis is also back.

Version 0.2.2
 - Includes changes from Tacvek/guest2 and Tiddles. Their updates include a registry value for setting
the gamepad LEDs, and changing the LEDs when the guide button is pressed.
- Swaped the rumble motors back, this is their correct position.
- Disabled the deadzone function for more accuracy in the analog stick.

Version 0.2.1
 - Has the left and right rumble motors, the X and Y buttons, and the right stick's axes swapped.
 - Also the guide button now switches layouts. Thanks to Tiddles for some of this work.
 - A USB ID for the Pelican XSZ Wired Controller was also added.

Version 0.2.0
 - Contains support for rumble and sets the LEDs on the pad so that they do not blink (or stay off).

Version 0.1.1
 - This version contains an alternate method to detect if a connected pad is an Xbox 360 pad.
This means it will support more Xbox 360 compatiable gamepads.

Version 0.1.0
 - Initial version of modified driver.
